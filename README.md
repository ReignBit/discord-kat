# Kat Discord Bot (Version 3.2.5_h2)

### No longer being actively maintained
Due to Discord.py being discontinued, and with the uncertainty of the Discord API in 2022, I have decided to stop development on Kat for the foreseeable future. Changing to the new Slash commands, which Discord is trying to force bots to use, would require a complete rewrite of Kat - something I don't want to do for the 3rd time. Although, in the future I may create a new bot if the need arises.

Kat may work after April 2022, but there is no guarantee - Any Discord API update in the future could break functionality.

## Self-Hosting
Kat has not been tested for self-hosting, and is only on GitHub for version control. \
We may in the future think about releasing Kat for self-host use, but as of now we host Kat ourselves.\ You can invite her to your server here: \
